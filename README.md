## üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites

Before running the setup, ensure you have the following installed:

* **Python 3.x:** Download from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
* **Git:** Download from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/downloads/).
* **`tkinter`:** Usually included with standard Python 3 installations. If you encounter issues, ensure it's installed (e.g., `sudo apt-get install python3-tk` on Debian/Ubuntu, or ensure it was selected during Windows Python installation).

All other necessary Python libraries (`requests`, `pyobjc`) will be automatically installed by the setup script.

    * **Max macOS Version:** Enter the desired maximum major macOS version (e.g., `14` for Sonoma, `13` for Ventura).
    * **Find Recovery HDs:** Check this box to include Recovery HD images in the search.
    * **Prevent Sleep During Downloads (macOS only):** Keep your system awake while files are downloading.
    * **Save Catalog Locally:** Stores the downloaded Apple catalog plist file for faster future access.
    * **Force Local Catalog Reload:** Forces the GUI to re-download the catalog even if a local copy exists.
    * **Download Directory:** Click "Browse" to choose where downloaded macOS installers will be saved.

2.  **Refresh Catalog:**
    * Click the "Refresh Catalog" button to fetch the latest list of macOS products based on your current settings.
    * The status bar will update, and the product treeview will populate with available installers.

3.  **Download Selected Product:**

## üêõ Troubleshooting

* **"Error: Python 3 or higher is required."**: Ensure you are running the `setup.py` with `python` command that points to Python 3. If you have multiple Python versions, try `python3 setup.py`.
* **"Error: Git is not installed..."**: Install Git from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/downloads/).
* **"Failed to install [package name]" during setup:** This usually indicates network issues or permission problems. Try running the pip command manually (e.g., `pip install requests`). If permissions are an issue, consider `pip install --user [package name]` or use a virtual environment.
* **GUI doesn't launch (Tkinter errors):** Ensure `tkinter` is correctly installed with your Python distribution. It's often an optional component during Python installation.
* **Downloads failing with "Download failed or was interrupted (no specific error)" or "missing positional arguments":**
    These issues suggest that the modified `downloader.py` might not have been correctly copied, or there's a version mismatch.
    1.  Ensure you cloned *this* repository correctly.
    2.  Rerun `python setup.py` to ensure the `downloader.py` is copied.
    3.  Check the `gibMacOS/Scripts/downloader.py` file to confirm it matches the corrected version you received.
